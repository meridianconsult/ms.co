Coming soon...

(... from index.html) At this point, the company decided to pivot and start providing consultancy services
on outsourced software projects. From official company websites to web apps to mobile apps, we sharpened our programming skills as we worked on each of these projects. Many projects were successful and, as expected, some didn't live up to their expectations, but this journey has brought tremendous growth and knowledge to Meridian (as we insiders call it).

Our plans for the future can be summarised in the list below:
- Release quality web and mobile apps for Meridian Appz Inc.
- Register subsidiary companies (Meridian Appz Inc, Meridian Consult Inc, Meridian Fund Inc). All of which tackle specific types of projects.
- Bring on board the most creative technology and business talent to push the company to the sky.
- Build a highly sustainable business for IPO.

As we move towards a bright future, we plan to add more creative people to this already solid team of technology entrepreneurs.
